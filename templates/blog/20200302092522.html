<h2> Introduction to Web system development using Perl and Mojolicious </ h2>

<b> Introduction to Web System Development </ b> is <a href="https://en.mojolicious.perlzemi.com/"> Mojolicious </a> <a href="https://en.perlzemi" An introductory course on web system development using the .com / "> Perl </a> web framework.

Perl has a web framework called Mojolicious that makes it easy and flexible to create web applications.

With Mojolicious, you can build a web system that has both development efficiency and performance.

<h3> Features of Mojolicious </ h3>

Features of Mojolicious

<h4> Embedded development server </ h4>

Mojolicious has a development web server that can be booted in a Linux environment. With a development web server, you can run your web application in a local environment, so you can repeat your development work faster and improve your development efficiency.

<h4> Prefork + asynchronous I / O production server </ h4>

Mojolicious has a performance-optimized production web server that can be booted in a Linux environment. Start the production server with prefork + asynchronous I / O.

By pre-forking the child process, we prepare for HTTP requests in advance. Prefolk allows you to wait for requests in parallel.

Each child process is asynchronous I / O and receives an HTTP request. Asynchronous I / O is a scalable implementation that the architecture can withstand over 10,000 simultaneous connections.

<h4> Hot deployment </ h4>

Hot deployment is a technology for restarting a production server without shutting it down completely. The server will be restarted to prevent loss of HTTP requests.

<h4> Template </ h4>

Mojolicious has a template to use for HTML output. It is possible to output dynamically using Perl code in the template.


<h4> JSON support </ h4>

Mojolicious's API supports JSON. It's easy to receive JSON with AJAX and draw JSON.

<h4> Functions are limited to the Web layer </ h4>

Mojolicious is a web framework with limited functionality at the web tier. Accessing the database is not included as a feature of the web framework.

You are free to choose and use the database access module (eg <a href="https://dbix-en.custom.perlzemi.com/"> DBIx :: Custom </a>).

<h4> Asynchronous I / O HTTP client </ h4>

Mojolicious contains an HTTP client for asynchronous I / O. When throwing an HTTP request to an external service, you can send the HTTP request without blocking.

<h4> Small web app </ h4>

A module included with Mojolicious called Mojolicious :: Lite allows you to create a web app in three lines.

<pre>
use Mojolicious :: Lite;
get'/' => sub {shift-> render (text =>'Hello')};
app-> start;
</ pre>

This is the smallest web application that displays Hello on the screen.

<h4> High compatibility and security security </ h4>

Mojolicious is continuously maintained and will be fixed as soon as a security issue arises. Sometimes it breaks compatibility, but in principle it's backwards compatible and easy to upgrade. Perl itself is also very backwards compatible.

<h4> Good compatibility with Perl's GC </ h3>

Perl has a GC optimized for average response speed called reference counting GC.

This works well with Mojolicious's asynchronous I / O web server.

For asynchronous I / O, low average latency is very important for good performance, but Perl is optimized for average response speed.

<h3> Would you like to start web system development with Perl & Mojolicious? </ H3>

Want to start web system development with Perl & Mojolicious?

The combination of Perl and Mojolicious goes very well with web system development.

High development efficiency with a concise description, high execution performance by prefork + asynchronous I / O.

Please compare it with other methods.
