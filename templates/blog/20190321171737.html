<h2> "Perl + Mojolicious" Web application development with Sakura VPS Part 3 Let's apply for VPS </ h2>



Let's apply for the cheapest plan of Sakura VPS for 980 yen per month. It doesn't start without applying.

<h3> Sakura VPS application </ h3>

First of all, let's apply for Sakura VPS.

Sakura VPS

The 980 yen plan is the cheapest plan. As web services grow, you can move to a plan with better performance, memory, and hard disk space.

Let's do our best to reach the point where the application is completed. It's easy to forget your ID and password when you applied, so make a note of them in a place where you can find them properly. This is really important. If you don't look at your ID for a while, you won't know where you really went.

<h3> Notification of application acceptance completion </ h3>
By the way, when you complete the application, you will receive an email "Notice of completion of application acceptance".

</ pre>

If you look at the email, you will find the above information. An IP address is like where a VPS server resides. You will use this IP address to access and configure the server settings.

The server is set from the control panel <b> https://secure.sakura.ad.jp/vpscontrol/ </ b>, so bookmark it exactly.

The user name root is the user name as a VPS administrator. Please note that you are not the administrator user used on Linux / Unix. It will be the user name and password for logging in from the VPS control panel. You can install and reinstall the OS, so keep it in a safe place.

<h3> Member ID and password, VPS root user and password are saved properly </ h3>

In my experience, if you don't log in for a week or two, you'll be in a bad state. Therefore, it is important to make a good note so that you can find it quickly.

Next is booting the OS with VPS.
