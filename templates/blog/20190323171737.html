<h2> "Perl + Mojolicious" Web application development with Sakura VPS 5th Server startup </h2>



Last time, you went to the control panel login. Today, I would like to start the server. It's easy, just press the "Start" button of the virtual server operation on the VPS control screen.

<pre>
Just press the start button
</pre>

The status changes during operation.

<h3> Try logging in to the server using the remote console </h3>

Then, I wonder what to do next. Now that you've started the server, let's log in to that server. This is the first step.

Sakura VPS has a function called remote console, so you can operate the server from a browser using commands.

<pre>
You can execute commands on the remote console
</pre>

You can access the remote console from the "remote console" on the left side of the "VPS control panel screen".

The following display is displayed on the console screen, waiting for you to log in.

<pre>

If you have been developing just uploading files by FTP, you may be a little surprised at this screen. You will find it a little difficult.

However, in reality, it is easy if you get used to it a little, and the more you learn, the better the development efficiency will be, and you will be able to automate the program. As a programmer, in order to become a full-fledged person, you must avoid it. Of course, programmers rather than designers are worth remembering.

Then, let's log in. First, say "root" and press the "Enter" key.

</pre>
root
<pre>

This means logging in as the root user.

(The remote console tends to be unstable. I accessed it in Chrome, but it didn't accept the keyboard. Somehow I could use FireFox. It seems that it may recover after a while. So, if you can't enter a string, let's wait a bit.)

Next is the password entry. The initial password is the same as the password when you logged in to the "VPS Control Panel".

</pre>
Enter password
<pre>

Even if you enter the password, it will not be visible on the screen. It is designed not to be seen by other people. After entering the password, press Enter. If the password is correct, you can log in.

The screen will look like the one below.

</pre>
[root @www11123ue ~] #
<pre>

When it starts with #, it means that you are logged in as the root user. For the time being, you can now log in.

However, if you log in on the command screen for the first time, you may be worried about what you are doing.

Next time, I would like to explain what this is all about. Let's go up the stairs little by little.
